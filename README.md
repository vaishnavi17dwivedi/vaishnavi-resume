# Vaishnavi Dwivedi — Resume Website (Portfolio Card Layout)

This repository contains a responsive portfolio-style resume website built using plain HTML, CSS and a small JS helper. It is ready to be deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — small helpers (smooth scroll, year)
- `assets/photo.jpg` — profile photo (rename/upload)
- `assets/Vaishnavi_Dwivedi_Resume.pdf` — downloadable CV (rename/upload)

## How to use
1. Place your chosen photo into `assets/photo.jpg`. The recommended photo is the white printed top on the lawn (professional look).
2. Place your resume PDF into `assets/Vaishnavi_Dwivedi_Resume.pdf`.
3. Commit and push everything to a GitHub repository.
4. In repository settings -> Pages, set branch `main` (or `gh-pages`) and folder `/ (root)` to publish. The site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Editing content
Open `index.html` and edit the text inside the cards (About, Experience, Education, etc.) if you want to update wording, add projects, or change links.

## Notes
- This site uses no external frameworks for maximum portability.
- The content was autofilled using the uploaded resume PDF. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
